# Sabeel 🌿

_A daily Islamic learning app for peaceful, consistent growth_

Sabeel (Arabic: سبيل) means "a path" — and this app is designed to help you walk a gentle, enriching path of learning about Islam, one small step at a time. Whether you’re new to Islamic teachings or looking to reconnect, Sabeel delivers 5-minute daily lessons that build knowledge, habit, and reflection.

## 🕌 Vision

To make Islamic learning accessible, approachable, and part of everyday life — in multiple languages, for all ages.

We believe that consistent, bite-sized learning is key to deeper understanding and long-term spiritual growth. Sabeel is being built with love and intention, not just as a product, but as a meaningful resource for the global Muslim community.
