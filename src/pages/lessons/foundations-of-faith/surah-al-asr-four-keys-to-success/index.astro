          Have you ever heard a grown-up say, 'Time is running out!'
          or 'Don't waste time!'? Well, Allah has given us a very
          short but very, very important message about time and how
          to use it best.

            <strong>Sūrat al-ʿAsr</strong>
            <br />
            By the time! People are surely losing— except those who believe,
            do good, tell each other what is right, and help each other
            be patient. (Qur'an 103:1-3)

        <p>
          If you have a special piggy bank, and every day a little
          bit of money disappears, that's being 'in loss,' right?
          Allah says our time is like that money. Every minute that
          goes by, we're losing it, unless we fill it with four
          special treasures!
        </p>
        <p>
          What are these four treasures?
          <ol>
            <li>
              <b>Īmān (Belief):</b> The first treasure is to believe
              in Allah with all your heart, truly knowing He is the One,
              the Creator, and loves you.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>ʿAmal-sāliḥ(Good deeds):</b> The second treasure is
              to do good things! Like sharing your toys, being kind to
              your friends, helping your parents, or saying 'Alhamdulillah'
              for your food. This shows your belief in action!
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Tawāṣbil-ḥaqq (Reminding of Truth):</b> The third treasure
              is to remind each other about what is true and right. If
              you see your friend doing something wrong, gently remind
              them of the right way. Or remind your family about Salah
              time!
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Tawāṣbil-ṣabr (Supporting in Patience):</b> The last
              treasure is to help each other be patient. Sometimes things
              are hard, like waiting for your turn or when you feel upset.
              We help each other be strong and patient, like when we
              wait for our Salah time patiently.
            </li>
          </ol>
        </p>
        <p>
          Only when we fill our time with these four treasures are
          we truly winning, not losing!

          <p>
            Sūrat al-ʿAsr is a profound reminder of the value of
            time and the essential elements for a successful life,
            both worldly and in the Hereafter. You can explain how
            time is a gift, constantly depleting, and its true
            'profit' comes from investing it in these four areas.
            Emphasize that <code>Īmān</code> is the foundation, and the
            other three are about living that belief individually and
            communally. For <code>Tawāṣbil-haqq</code> and <code
              >Tawāṣbil-sabr</code
            >, stress the gentle, encouraging approach, not
            lecturing.

                <li>
                  <code>Tawāṣbil-ḥaqq</code> - Yellow bead for reminding

          Time feels slow in class and lightning-fast at exam week.
          The Qur'an addresses this feeling directly in Sūrat
          al-ʿAsr, one of its shortest yet most impactful chapters.
          Allah begins by swearing by Time itself, immediately
          drawing our attention to its immense value. Then comes the
          stark truth: 'Indeed, mankind is in loss.' It's a wake-up
          call - every moment that passes is a loss unless we invest
          it wisely.
        </p>
        <p>
          But there's an exception, a blueprint for true success,
          outlined in four interconnected principles:
          <ol>
            <li>
              <b>Īmān (Faith):</b> This is the foundation. It's about
              anchoring your heart in genuine belief in Allah, His Angels,
              Books, Messengers, the Last Day, and Divine Decree. It's
              not just head-knowledge, but a deep conviction that shapes
              your outlook.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>ʿAmal-sāliḥ (Righteous Deeds):</b> Belief isn't passive;
              it leads to action. Amal-ṣāliḥ means turning your Īmān
              into positive, constructive deeds – being kind, honest,
              respectful, upholding prayers, striving for excellence,
              and contributing positively to your environment. These
              are the fruits of true faith.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Tawāṣbil-haqq (Reminding Each Other of Truth):</b> This
              means more than just speaking the truth. It's about actively
              advocating for justice, integrity, and Islamic principles,
              and gently encouraging others towards them. In a world
              full of misinformation, being a beacon of truth is crucial.
              It's about being a supportive voice for what is right,
              even when it's challenging.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b
                >Tawāṣbil-sabr (Supporting Each Other in Patience):</b
              > The path of truth and good deeds isn't always easy. Sabr
              (patience, perseverance, steadfastness) is essential. This
              principle calls us to encourage and support one another
              in enduring difficulties, in remaining firm on good, and
              in resisting temptation. It's about building a resilient
              community where everyone lifts each other up.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            These four elements aren't optional extras; they're the
            complete, interconnected formula for escaping 'loss' and
            achieving enduring success in both this life and the
            Hereafter. They transform fleeting time into everlasting
            reward.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Prophet ﷺ said, "The strong believer is better… but
            in each there is good." Strength is consistency, not
            biceps.

          Sūrat al-ʿAṣr, though comprising just three verses,
          encapsulates a complete methodology for human success and
          salvation. Allah begins by taking an oath 'by Time,' a
          profound emphasis on the fleeting nature of our earthly
          existence and the urgency of its utilization. The
          subsequent declaration, 'Indeed, mankind is in loss,'
          serves as a sobering universal indictment, asserting that
          without conscious adherence to a specific framework, human
          existence is inherently unprofitable, culminating in
          ultimate regret.
        </p>
        <p>
          Imām al-Shāfiʿī said this sûrah alone would suffice as
          proof. Notice its structure:

          <table>
            <thead>
              <tr>
                <th>Word/Phrase</th>
                <th>Nuance</th>

                  >Allah takes an oath by the slipping of time;

                <td

                  that operate together.</td

              </tr>
            </tbody>
          </table>

        <p>
          <b>Why four, not one?</b> Faith without action is claim. Action
          without faith may be hollow. Truth without patience becomes
          harsh; patience without truth becomes passive. Balance is the
          goal.
        </p>
        <h3 class="!mb-0">Historical Echo:</h3>
        <p>
          Early Muslims recited Sūrat al-ʿAṣr before parting, a
          polite code for "Use your hours well until we meet again."
        </p>
        <p>
          The Surah then delineates four interconnected pillars that
          constitute the path to redemption and true prosperity:
          <ol>
            <li>
              <b>Īmān (Faith):</b> This is the foundational anchor. It
              refers to a comprehensive, sincere belief in Allah, His
              angels, books, messengers, the Day of Judgment, and Divine
              Decree. It's <code>Īmān</code> that provides the correct
              worldview and motivation for righteous living. Without
              this internal conviction, all subsequent actions lack true
              spiritual weight.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>ʿAmal-ṣāliḥ (Righteous Deeds):</b>
              <code>Īmān</code> is inert without
              <code>ʿAmal-ṣāliḥ</code>. These are deeds that are
              good, sincere, and performed in accordance with divine
              guidance. They are the practical manifestation of <code
                >Īmān</code
              >, shaping character (akhlaq) and translating belief
              into tangible benefit for oneself and society. The
              quality of <code>Īmān</code> is reflected in the consistency
              and excellence of one's <code>ʿAmal-ṣāliḥ</code>.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Tawāṣbil-ḥaqq (Mutual Reminding of Truth):</b> This
              pillar moves beyond individual righteousness to collective
              responsibility. It is the active, compassionate enjoinment
              of truth and justice, and the gentle discouragement of
              falsehood and wrongdoing. In an era of rampant misinformation
              and moral relativism, <code>Tawāṣbil-ḥaqq</code> demands
              courage, wisdom, and an unwavering commitment to propagating
              the authentic message of Islam, always with sincerity and
              appropriate means.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b
                >Tawāṣbil-ṣabr (Mutual Support in
                Patience/Perseverance):</b
              > The path of <code>ḥaqq</code> is fraught with challenges.
              <code>Ṣabr</code> encompasses patience in obedience to
              Allah, patience in abstaining from sins, and patience in
              the face of adversity. This pillar stresses the communal
              aspect: we are not to endure alone, but to actively counsel
              and support one another in steadfastness, building a resilient
              <code>Ummah</code> capable of weathering trials and remaining
              firm on truth.
            </li>
          </ol>
        </p>
        <p>
          These four keys work together. They are not separate
          things. If you have all four, you use your time well. You
          are not losing out. You are building a life that is
          successful now and also for when we return to Allah. They
          help you live with purpose.

              <b>Identify a Gap:</b>
              Reflect honestly on which of the four keys from Sūrat al-ʿAṣr
              you find most challenging to consistently implement in
              your daily life. Is it reinforcing your Īmān, consistently
              performing ʿAmal-ṣāliḥ, speaking the ḥaqq to others (or
              even yourself), or exercising ṣabr with grace?
            </li>

            <li>
              <b>Formulate a Small, Actionable Step:</b>
              Choose one tiny, specific action you can take in the next
              24 hours to address that identified gap. For example, if
              it's Īmān, spend 2 minutes reflecting on an Ayah of the
              Qur'an; if Tawāṣbil-ḥaqq, gently correct a minor falsehood
              you hear.
            </li>

            <li>
              <b>Seek Support (Optional):</b>
              If Tawāṣbil-ṣabr is your focus, reach out to a trusted
              friend or mentor for encouragement or simply to share a
              challenge you're facing, actively seeking 'support in patience'.
