        <h3>The Creator of All Things: A Lesson in Faith</h3>

        <p>
          Step outside for a moment. Look up at the sky, feel the
          wind, and listen to the sounds around you. Have you ever
          wondered, "Who made all of this?"
        </p>

        <p>
          From the soft rustling of leaves to the towering mountains
          and the vast, star-studded sky — every single thing was
          created by Allah. And not just created, but brought to life
          with unmatched perfection and balance, without needing any
          help.
        </p>

        <p>
          In Surah Al-Zumar, Allah reminds us:

          <blockquote>
            Allah is the Creator of all things, and He is, over all
            things, Disposer of affairs. (Quran 39:62)
          </blockquote>
        </p>

        <p>
          For a child, this can be as simple as looking at a toy.
          Imagine your favorite LEGO set. Could it build itself
          without someone putting the pieces together? No way. But
          Allah said 'Be!' — and everything in the universe came into
          existence. Allah didn't need tools, hands, or helpers. It
          all happened by His command.
        </p>
        <p>
          For a teenager, think about the intricate systems that keep
          life moving — the way our bodies work, the way the rain
          falls, the way day and night follow each other without fail.
          All of it happens perfectly, without Allah needing anything
          in return. Before time and space, Allah was already there —
          self-sufficient, existing without need.
        </p>
        <p>
          For an adult, this verse is a call to reflect on our own
          dependencies. We lean on our jobs for income, our families
          for support, and our health for strength. But Allah? He is
          the One who provides all these things without relying on
          anything or anyone. He commands, and it is done. He is the
          Master, the Sustainer, the Disposer of all affairs.
        </p>
        <p>
          So, the next time life feels out of control, pause. Breathe.
          Look at the sky, the earth, and even your own heartbeat.
          Allah, the Creator of all things, is still in control. And
          the One who created everything is more than capable of
          taking care of you and your affairs.
        </p>
